## Download

Download the latest compiled version of the app from the [releases tab](https://github.com/bl791/echo-status/releases)
## Building

This GitHub repo contains only the source code for the Echo-Status app, the remaining files must be generated by Flutter.

```
flutter create . --project-name echo_status
flutter pub get
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

To build the APK, run:

```
flutter build apk --release
```

This will output a `.apk` file in the `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/` directory. You can copy this `.apk` file onto your Android-compatible IoT device.
